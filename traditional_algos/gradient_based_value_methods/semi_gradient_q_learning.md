**Semi Gradient Q Learning** is a reinforcement learning algorithm that approximates the action-value function using an approximate function, while applying the Q-Learning update rule. The "semi-gradient" refers to the fact that the gradient is taken only with respect to the approximated Q-values, without accounting for the impact of the update on future estimates. This method allows Q-Learning to scale to problems with large state spaces but introduces approximation bias, making it sensitive to learning rate and function approximation errors.
