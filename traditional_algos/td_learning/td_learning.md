**Temporal Difference Learning (TD Learning)** can be seen as a combination of Dynamic Programming and the Monte Carlo Method. On one hand, it utilizes sampling from the environment to estimate its value function. On the other hand, it updates estimates based on bootstrapping, where current estimates are updated using existing estimates rather than waiting until the end of an episode.

Given that reason, TD Learning inherits the advantages of both methods but also introduces some new challenges. Firstly, it does not rely on a model like Dynamic Programming. Secondly, it has lower variance compared to Monte Carlo methods. However, due to its reliance on bootstrapping, it can introduce bias, leading to convergence issues in some cases, especially when the learning rate is not properly tuned.
