**Q-Learning** is an off-policy method that seeks to find the optimal action-selection policy for any given finite Markov Decision Process (MDP). Unlike on-policy methods like Sarsa, Q-Learning updates the Q-values using the maximum possible future reward (greedy action) rather than the action chosen by the current policy. This makes Q-Learning off-policy, as it learns the optimal policy independently of the policy used to explore the environment.
