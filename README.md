Classic-RL-Algorithms
This repository offers a comprehensive collection of classic reinforcement learning algorithms. It includes a detailed implementation of traditional methods such as:

Dynamic Programming: 
- Policy Iteration 
- Value Iteration
Monte Carlo Methods 
- Monte Carlo
Temporal Difference Learning 
- SARSA, Expected-SARSA, N-Step SARSA
- Q-Learning: Q-Learning, Double Q-Learning
Policy Gradient Methods:
- REINFORCE, REINFORCE with Baseline 
- Actor-Critic

Additionally, the repository also covers modern deep reinforcement learning techniques like DQN (Deep Q-Learning) and PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization). Whether you're exploring foundational techniques or state-of-the-art deep RL models, this repository serves as a valuable resource for both practice and learning.
