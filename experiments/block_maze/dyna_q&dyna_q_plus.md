**Use Dyna Q and Dyna Q+ to solve Blocked Maze**

An interesting issue in the Block Maze environment is that the agent may end up at the position of a new wall right when the walls are about to be updated. To avoid this, I implemented a delay in the update until the agent moves out of the new wall's position.

TODO: Exercise 8.4 in the RL Book.
